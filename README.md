# Arduino-lights
A simple arduino program that uses an adafruit touch shield to control neopixels.

#### Tools needed:
1. [Touch Shield](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1651)
2. [Neopixel LED strip](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1461)
3. [Power Supply](https://www.adafruit.com/products/276)
4. [DC Power Adapter](https://www.adafruit.com/products/368)
5. [JST SM Plug Cable](https://www.adafruit.com/products/318)
6. [JST SM Receptacle Cable](https://www.adafruit.com/products/319)

#### Setup
1. Open up the `.ino` file  in the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software)
2. Download the necessary libraries which can be found [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide?view=all#arduino-library) and [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-8-tft-touch-shield-v2?view=all#adafruit-gfx-library)
3. Wire up the neopixels to your arduino board. Use this [neopixel guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-neopixel-uberguide?view=all) [touch shield guide](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-2-8-tft-touch-shield-v2?view=all#connecting) if you need help setting it up
4. Hook up your arduino to your computer via USB and upload the sketch
5. Viola! Now you can use the touch shield as a controller to change the colors of the neopixels
